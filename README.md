## About pandas
### Pandas is the go-to package for working with big data sets in Python. It's made for working with data sets generally below or around 1GB in size, but really this limit varies depending on the memory constraints of the device you run it on. A good rule of thumb is have at least five to ten times the amount of memory on the device as your dataset. Once the dataset starts to exceed the single-digit gigabyte range, it's generally recommended using a different library such as Vaex.
